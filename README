Very simple mysql database backup based on mysqldump
----------------------------------------------------

Features:
- Very simple
- Different retention on a daily and monthly backups (ie. you may have daily
  backup for last x days and monthly backups for last y months)
- Simple backup check (rely only on a backup filesize)
- Free license

Antifeatures:
- Not tested well
- "Crazy stuff" like spaces in a filenames is probably not handled
- No deduplication, no compression (yet)
- It is done just for me. It is hosted only for backup purposes.

Caveats:
- The latest backup may be "hidden" in a monthly folder (if there is no
  monthly backup for particular month, the daily backup is *moved* to the
  monthly folder.

Installation:
- See INSTALLATION
